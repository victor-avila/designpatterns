a mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner

objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
composition let us make composed objects
  e.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions
        a grouping of shapes thta consists of several shapes
the pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite (aggregate) objects in the same manner
  i.e., Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs
