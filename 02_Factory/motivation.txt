- object creation logic becomes too convoluted
- constructor is not descriptive
  name mandated by name of containing type
  cannot overload with same set of argument types with different name
  can turn into 'optional parameter hell', all paramas are optional and the user
  has to know when to use some or the others
- object creation (non-piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsorced to:
  a separate function (factory method)
  that may exists in a separate class (factory)
  can create hierarchy of factories (abstract factory)

factory
a component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects
