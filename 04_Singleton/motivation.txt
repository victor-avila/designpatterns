a design pattern everyone loves to hate

- for some components it only make sense to have one instance in the system
 - database repository
 - object factory, isn't supposed to have state
- e.g., the constructor call is expensive
 - we only do it once
 - we provide anyone creating additional copies
 - need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety

 singleton
a component which is instatiated only once
