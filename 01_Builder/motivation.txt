some objects are simple and can be created on a single constructor call
other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive
instead opt for piecewise construction
builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step
when piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly
