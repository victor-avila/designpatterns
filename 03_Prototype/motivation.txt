- complicated objects (e.g., cars) aren't designed from scratch
  - they reiterate existing desgins
- an existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype
- we make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
  - requires 'deep copy' support
- we make the cloning convenient (e.g., via a factory)

prototype
a partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of
